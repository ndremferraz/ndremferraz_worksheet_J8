## Question 5. Why has software engineering evolved to often embrace agile development models over waterfall ones?
As software became a more complex and more applied to day-to-day uses, a lot of times it becomes hard to fully follow the SDE life cycle specially the part related to requirement gathering because those can change based on user feedback or sometimes there is no way of knowing certain requirements ahead of time. Therefore, SDE has given preference to methodolgies that emphasize quick and adaptable development.
